            Meet app is a Progressive Web App (PWA) built with React and coded
            using a test-driven development process. The app uses the Google
            Calendar API to fetch upcoming events from a a CareerFoundry events
            calendar.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once logged in, the app is a single page app with two inputs, one
            for a city name, and one for a number of events to show. Simply
            input your desired city and select it from the suggestions dropdown,
            then narrow down or increase the number of events shown with using
            the number input. Clicking on the "more details" button for an event
            will display a description and URL for the event. Clicking the event
            URL will redirect you to the Google Calendar event.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Meet app is using
            https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events.readonly for
            educational purposes only. The calendar accessed isn’t the user’s
            but a calendar provided by CareerFoundry as part of their Full-Stack
            Immersion course. No user information is saved or used within the
            application, and personal calendars aren’t accessed.
